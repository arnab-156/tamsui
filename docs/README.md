## Developing Locally

* [Running the Application](#running-the-application)
* [Project Directories](#project-directories)
* [Adding an Application Directory](#adding-an-application-directory)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Pull Request Template](#pull-request-template)
* [Github Workflow](#github-workflow)

### Running the Application

Run `npm run watch` to run the development watch server.

`npm run dev` will build and run the application in development mode. `npm run prod` will build and run the application in production mode. All of the above modes will run the server output through [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty).

### Project Directories

The `client/` directory is intended to house files specific to the client-side bundle. At the moment it only contains the entrypoint file, which [mounts and hydrates the root application](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot).

The `app/` directory houses application-level concerns: the root application contains the html root, head, and body. The routes are housed in [app/dataRoutes](../app/dataRoutes) as a [data routes object](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route). The reason the routes are not declared in [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) is for compatibility with rendering [React to a Node.js stream](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream).

The `pages/` directory houses the page-level react components. These are plugged into the application via the [dataRoutes object](../app/dataRoutes).

The `server/` directory houses the server-side rendering logic and defines the static asset directories. [Pino](https://getpino.io/) is implemented as the logger.

### Adding an Application Directory

To add additional application directories, or to remove existing ones:
* Path aliases need to be updated
* Jest projects need to be updated

The `app/` and `pages/` directories are set up with path aliases so that a module can be imported with absolute pathing rather than relative pathing:

```javascript
import module from 'app/module';

import PageModule from 'pages/PageModule';
```

If any directory is removed, or if a new directory needs an alias:
* An `alias` should be updated in the [webpack configs](../webpack/resolve.js).
* The [alias mapping](https://github.com/johvin/eslint-import-resolver-alias?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) should be added to the [eslint configuration](../.eslintrc.js) to avoid linting errors when using the alias.
* The alias should be updated in the [paths configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) for TypeScript to avoid type errors.
* The alias should be updated in the [moduleNameMapper configuration](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring) in the [Jest configuration](../jest.config.js) to ensure module mocking will work in tests, and so there are no errors in using the alias.
* The directory should be updated in the `appConfig`Â·`testMatch` array to ensure that test runner knows which directories to cover.

### Testing

**Tamsui** utilizes [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as test runner. Tests should be housed in a `__tests__/` directory and/or contain the extension `.test.js` anywhere within the [project directories](#project-directories).

The default [coverage threshhold](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#coveragethreshold-object) is set to 100% across the board. To reduce or remove the test coverage requirements, modify the `coverageThreshold` field in the [config](../jest.config.js).

### Pull Request Template

**Tamsui** contains a [Github Pull Request template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) that is intended to provide a scaffold for a thorough pull request. [This template](../.github/pull_request_template.md) provides the following sections:

* `Description`:
  * Link to a related issue/story - important for documentation of why this change is being made
  * A prompt to provide a description of the intent of the changes
* `Changes`: A prompt to list the code changes in the pull request
* `Steps to QA`: A prompt to provide steps for reviewers to verify the changes achieve their intended result

The reason for these sections is two-fold:
1. Make it easier for reviewers to review the code changes, with full context of the reasons the changes are being made, in order that the team can produce the best results for the codebase.
2. Provide a history of documentation in the repository, so that every significant change is documented and vetted. This can be useful in the future to trace changes and intent when debugging or extending the codebase.

### Github Workflow

**Tamsui** contains a [Github workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) configured to [run the linter and test runner](../.github/workflows/lint-test.yml) on [push events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push). If this is not desired, [disable the workflow in Github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow#disabling-a-workflow).
